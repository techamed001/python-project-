# python-project-
Develop a text-based game in Python with an
engaging storyline and interactive gameplay.
Implement features such as character creation,
decision-making, and branching story paths.
Use clear and intuitive command inputs for
player actions. Incorporate elements like
inventory management, puzzles, and quests.
Ensure a modular code structure for easy
updates and expansions. Optimize for
readability and performance.
Include thorough documentation and 
comments for maintainability.
Test extensively to ensure smooth gameplay
and bug-free experience.class Character:
